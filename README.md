# CS-395 Project: System Monitor Application

This project provides a **System Monitor Application** that allows users to monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage, manage logged-in users, view system processes, and inspect system logs through a secure web-based interface. The application is developed using **Python (aiohttp)** for the backend and **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the frontend. It is containerized using **Docker**, making it deployable as a service on any platform.

## Features

- **Secure Login:** Fixed credentials for 5 users, with login/logout tracking.
- **System Monitoring:**
  - CPU, memory, and disk usage statistics.
  - Current and last 10 logged-in users.
  - System uptime.
  - Active processes (PID, CPU, memory usage).
  - System logs (last 50 entries).
- **Dynamic Updates:** Real-time updates every few seconds using RESTful APIs.
- **Containerized Deployment:** Fully Dockerized for easy setup and scalability.
- **Dynamic Port Mapping:** Maps your Linux user ID as the port for isolation and ease of deployment.
- **HTTPS Support:** Secure communication via SSL/TLS certificates.

## Setup and Running

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- **Docker**: For containerization.
- **Docker Compose**: For managing multi-container applications.
- **Git**: To clone the repository.

---

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cs-395-project

```
---

---

## Docker Deployment

### 1. Build and Run the Application

To run the application as a background service, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Dockerized Application**:
   ```bash
   docker compose build
   ```

2. **Start the application using Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   This will expose the application on port `8765`, making it accessible only via `localhost` or your local network IP.

---

### 2. Accessing the Application

- **Login Page**: `http://localhost:8765/`  
  or `http://<local IP>:8765/`
- **Dashboard**: Automatically redirects upon successful login.

For example, to access the application on your local machine, navigate to:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:8765/frontend/
   ```
   or, if accessing via a local network:
   ```bash
   http://<local IP>:8765/
   ```

---

### 3. Stopping the Application

To stop the application and remove the container, use:

   ```bash
   docker compose down

   ```

## Comments

During the development and deployment of this project, we faced significant challenges in configuring the application to work with the `cs395.org/<user ID>` URL on the provided server. Despite extensive efforts, including debugging port mapping issues, container logs, and server configurations, the setup consistently resulted in connection errors or `404` responses. Additionally, network-related issues on the server further complicated the process, as external access to the application proved unreliable. The requirement to dynamically map user IDs as ports introduced compatibility problems, and the server environment lacked the flexibility needed to fully implement the desired functionality. While the application performed flawlessly on local setups, replicating this success on the server was not feasible. To ensure a functional and accessible solution, we opted to run the application on `localhost` with a fixed port (`8765`). This decision prioritized reliability and usability, allowing the application to showcase its full range of features without being hindered by the server's limitations and network-related challenges.
